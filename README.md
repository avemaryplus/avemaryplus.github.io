You can see how the program works at the link: https://avemaryplus.github.io/list-pokemons/

### How it works:
* This is a program that shows a list of pokemon through an API request: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/
* When encountering any pokemon, you get information about what is obtained through an API request: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id}/
